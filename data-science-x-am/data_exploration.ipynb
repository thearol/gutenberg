      "below St. Louis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1830 it was a snug little collection of modest one- and two-story\n",
      "frame dwellings whose whitewashed exteriors were almost concealed from\n",
      "sight by climbing tangles of rose-vines, honeysuckles, and\n",
      "morning-glories. Each of these pretty homes had a garden in front fenced\n",
      "with white palings and opulently stocked with hollyhocks, marigolds,\n",
      "touch-me-nots, prince's-feathers and other old-fashioned flowers; while\n",
      "on the window-sills of the houses stood wooden boxes containing\n",
      "moss-rose plants and terra-cotta pots in which grew a breed of geranium\n",
      "whose spread of intensely red blossoms accented the prevailing pink tint\n",
      "of the rose-clad house-front like an explosion of flame. When there was\n",
      "room on the ledge outside of the pots and boxes for a cat, the cat was\n",
      "there--in sunny weather--stretched at full length, asleep and blissful,\n",
      "with her furry belly to the sun and a paw curved over her nose. Then\n",
      "that house was complete, and its contentment and peace were made\n",
      "manifest to the world by this symbol, whose testimony is infallible. A\n",
      "home without a cat--and a well-fed, well-petted and properly revered\n",
      "cat--may be a perfect home, perhaps, but how can it prove title?\n",
      "\n",
      "All along the streets, on both sides, at the outer edge of the brick\n",
      "sidewalks, stood locust-trees with trunks protected by wooden boxing,\n",
      "and these furnished shade for summer and a sweet fragrance in spring\n",
      "when the clusters of buds came forth. The main street, one block back\n",
      "from the river, and running parallel with it, was the sole business\n",
      "street. It was six blocks long, and in each block two or three brick\n",
      "stores three stories high towered above interjected bunches of little\n",
      "frame shops. Swinging signs creaked in the wind, the street's whole\n",
      "length. The candy-striped pole which indicates nobility proud and\n",
      "ancient along the palace-bordered canals of Venice, indicated merely the\n",
      "humble barber shop along the main street of Dawson's Landing. On a chief\n",
      "corner stood a lofty unpainted pole wreathed from top to bottom with tin\n",
      "pots and pans and cups, the chief tinmonger's noisy notice to the world\n",
      "(when the wind blew) that his shop was on hand for business at that\n",
      "corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hamlet's front was washed by the clear waters of the great river;\n",
      "its body stretched itself rearward up a gentle incline; its most\n",
      "rearward border fringed itself out and scattered its houses about the\n",
      "base-line of the hills; the hills rose high, inclosing the town in a\n",
      "half-moon curve, clothed with forests from foot to summit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Steamboats passed up and down every hour or so. Those belonging to the\n",
      "little Cairo line and the little Memphis line always stopped; the big\n",
      "Orleans liners stopped for hails only, or to land passengers or freight;\n",
      "and this was the case also with the great flotilla of \"transients.\"\n",
      "These latter came out of a dozen rivers--the Illinois, the Missouri, the\n",
      "Upper Mississippi, the Ohio, the Monongahela, the Tennessee, the Red\n",
      "River, the White River, and so on; and were bound every whither and\n",
      "stocked with every imaginable comfort or necessity which the\n",
      "Mississippi's communities could want, from the frosty Falls of St.\n",

      "Dawson's Landing was a slaveholding town, with a rich slave-worked grain\n",
      "and pork country back of it. The town was sleepy and comfortable and\n",
      "contented. It was fifty years old, and was growing slowly--very slowly,\n",
      "in fact, but still it was growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief citizen was York Leicester Driscoll, about forty years old,\n",
      "judge of the county court. He was very proud of his old Virginian\n",
      "ancestry, and in his hospitalities and his rather formal and stately\n",
      "manners he kept up its traditions. He was fine and just and generous. To\n",
      "be a gentleman--a gentleman without stain or blemish--was his only\n",
      "religion, and to it he was always faithful. He was respected, esteemed\n",
      "and beloved by all the community. He was well off, and was gradually\n",
      "adding to his store. He and his wife were very nearly happy, but not\n",
      "quite, for they had no children. The longing for the treasure of a child\n",
      "had grown stronger and stronger as the years slipped away, but the\n",
      "blessing never came--and was never to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "With this pair lived the Judge's widowed sister, Mrs. Rachel Pratt, and\n",
      "she also was childless--childless, and sorrowful for that reason, and\n",
      "not to be comforted. The women were good and commonplace people, and did\n",
      "their duty and had their reward in clear consciences and the community's\n",
      "approbation. They were Presbyterians, the Judge was a free-thinker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pembroke Howard, lawyer and bachelor, aged about forty, was another old\n",
      "Virginian grandee with proved descent from the First Families. He was a\n",
      "fine, brave, majestic creature, a gentleman according to the nicest\n",
      "requirements of the Virginia rule, a devoted Presbyterian, an authority\n",
      "on the \"code,\" and a man always courteously ready to stand up before you\n",
      "in the field if any act or word of his had seemed doubtful or suspicious\n",
      "to you, and explain it with any weapon you might prefer from brad-awls\n",
      "to artillery. He was very popular with the people, and was the Judge's\n",
      "dearest friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, another F. F. V. of\n",
      "formidable caliber--however, with him we have no concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Percy Northumberland Driscoll, brother to the Judge, and younger than he\n",
      "by five years, was a married man, and had had children around his\n",
      "hearthstone; but they were attacked in detail by measles, croup and\n",
      "scarlet fever, and this had given the doctor a chance with his effective\n",
      "antediluvian methods; so the cradles were empty. He was a prosperous\n",
      "man, with a good head for speculations, and his fortune was growing. On\n",
      "the 1st of February, 1830, two boy babes were born in his house: one to\n",
      "him, the other to one of his slave girls, Roxana by name. Roxana was\n",
      "twenty years old. She was up and around the same day, with her hands\n",
      "full, for she was tending both babies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. Percy Driscoll died within the week. Roxy remained in charge of the\n",
      "children. She had her own way, for Mr. Driscoll soon absorbed himself in\n",
      "his speculations and left her to her own devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "In that same month of February, Dawson's Landing gained a new citizen.\n",
      "This was Mr. David Wilson, a young fellow of Scotch parentage. He had\n",
      "wandered to this remote region from his birthplace in the interior of\n",
      "the State of New York, to seek his fortune. He was twenty-five years\n",
      "old, college-bred, and had finished a post-college course in an Eastern\n",
      "law school a couple of years before.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was a homely, freckled, sandy-haired young fellow, with an\n",
      "intelligent blue eye that had frankness and comradeship in it and a\n",
      "covert twinkle of a pleasant sort. But for an unfortunate remark of his,\n",
      "he would no doubt have entered at once upon a successful career at\n",
      "Dawson's Landing. But he made his fatal remark the first day he spent in\n",
      "the village, and it \"gaged\" him. He had just made the acquaintance of a\n",
      "group of citizens when an invisible dog began to yelp and snarl and howl\n",
      "and make himself very comprehensively disagreeable, whereupon young\n",
      "Wilson said, much as one who is thinking aloud--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish I owned half of that dog.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why?\" somebody asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because I would kill my half.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The group searched his face with curiosity, with anxiety even, but found\n",
      "no light there, no expression that they could read. They fell away from\n",
      "him as from something uncanny, and went into privacy to discuss him. One\n",
      "said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Pears to be a fool.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Pears?\" said another. \"Is, I reckon you better say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Said he wished he owned half of the dog, the idiot,\" said a third.\n",
      "\"What did he reckon would become of the other half if he killed his\n",
      "half? Do you reckon he thought it would live?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, he must have thought it, unless he is the downrightest fool in the\n",
      "world; because if he hadn't thought it, he would have wanted to own the\n",
      "whole dog, knowing that if he killed his half and the other half died,\n",
      "he would be responsible for that half just the same as if he had killed\n",
      "that half instead of his own. Don't it look that way to you, gents?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, it does. If he owned one half of the general dog, it would be so;\n",
      "if he owned one end of the dog and another person owned the other end,\n",
      "it would be so, just the same; particularly in the first case, because\n",
      "if you kill one half of a general dog, there ain't any man that can tell\n",
      "whose half it was, but if he owned one end of the dog, maybe he could\n",
      "kill his end of it and--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, he couldn't either; he couldn't and not be responsible if the other\n",
      "end died, which it would. In my opinion that man ain't in his right\n",
      "mind.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I'm with you, gentlemen,\" said No. 6. \"Perfect jackass--yes, and it\n",

      "liked too; but by that time the nickname had got well stuck on, and it\n",
      "stayed. That first day's verdict made him a fool, and he was not able to\n",
      "get it set aside, or even modified. The nickname soon ceased to carry\n",
      "any harsh or unfriendly feeling with it, but it held its place, and was\n",

      "manner of speech, a stranger would have expected her to be black, but\n",
      "she was not. Only one sixteenth of her was black, and that sixteenth did\n",
      "not show. She was of majestic form and stature, her attitudes were\n",

      "a noble and stately grace. Her complexion was very fair, with the rosy\n",
      "glow of vigorous health in the cheeks, her face was full of character\n",
      "and expression, her eyes were brown and liquid, and she had a heavy suit\n",
      "of fine soft hair which was also brown, but the fact was not apparent\n",
      "because her head was bound about with a checkered handkerchief and the\n",
      "hair was concealed under it. Her face was shapely, intelligent and\n",
      "comely--even beautiful. She had an easy, independent carriage--when she\n",

      "thirty-one parts white, and he, too, was a slave, and by a fiction of\n",
      "law and custom a negro. He had blue eyes and flaxen curls like his white\n",

      "for the white babe wore ruffled soft muslin and a coral necklace, while\n",

      "\n",
      "The next day--that is to say, on the 4th of September--something\n",
      "occurred which profoundly impressed Roxana. Mr. Driscoll missed another\n",
      "small sum of money--which is a way of saying that this was not a new\n",
      "thing, but had happened before. In truth it had happened three times\n",
      "before. Driscoll's patience was exhausted. He was a fairly humane man\n",
      "toward slaves and other animals; he was an exceedingly humane man toward\n",
      "the erring of his own race. Theft he could not abide, and plainly there\n",
      "was a thief in his house. Necessarily the thief must be one of his\n",
      "negroes. Sharp measures must be taken. He called his servants before\n",
      "him. There were three of these, besides Roxy: a man, a woman, and a boy\n",
      "twelve years old. They were not related. Mr. Driscoll said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have all been warned before. It has done no good. This time I will\n",

      "They all shuddered at the threat, for here they had a good home, and a\n",

      "honey, or something like that, that \"Marse Percy wouldn't mind or miss,\"\n",
      "but not money--never a cent of money. They were eloquent in their\n",
      "protestations, but Mr. Driscoll was not moved by them. He answered each\n",
      "in turn with a stern \"Name the thief!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth was, all were guilty but Roxana; she suspected that the others\n",
      "were guilty, but she did not know them to be so. She was horrified to\n",
      "think how near she had come to being guilty herself; she had been saved\n",
      "in the nick of time by a revival in the colored Methodist Church, a\n",
      "fortnight before, at which time and place she \"got religion.\" The very\n",
      "next day after that gracious experience, while her change of style was\n",
      "fresh upon her and she was vain of her purified condition, her master\n",
      "left a couple dollars lying unprotected on his desk, and she happened\n",
      "upon that temptation when she was polishing around with a dust-rag. She\n",
      "looked at the money awhile with a steady rising resentment, then she\n",

      "\n",
      "Then she covered the tempter with a book, and another member of the\n",
      "kitchen cabinet got it. She made this sacrifice as a matter of religious\n",
      "etiquette; as a thing necessary just now, but by no means to be wrested\n",
      "into a precedent; no, a week or two would limber up her piety, then she\n",
      "would be rational again, and the next two dollars that got left out in\n",
      "the cold would find a comforter--and she could name the comforter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was she bad? Was she worse than the general run of her race? No. They\n",
      "had an unfair show in the battle of life, and they held it no sin to\n",
      "take military advantage of the enemy--in a small way; in a small way,\n",
      "but not in a large one. They would smouch provisions from the pantry\n",
      "whenever they got a chance; or a brass thimble, or a cake of wax, or an\n",
      "emery-bag, or a paper of needles, or a silver spoon, or a dollar bill,\n",
      "or small articles of clothing, or any other property of light value; and\n",
      "so far were they from considering such reprisals sinful, that they would\n",
      "go to church and shout and pray the loudest and sincerest with their\n",
      "plunder in their pockets. A farm smoke-house had to be kept heavily\n",
      "padlocked, for even the colored deacon himself could not resist a ham\n",
      "when Providence showed him in a dream, or otherwise, where such a thing\n",
      "hung lonesome and longed for some one to love. But with a hundred\n",
      "hanging before him the deacon would not take two--that is, on the same\n",
      "night. On frosty nights the humane negro prowler would warm the end of a\n",
      "plank and put it up under the cold claws of chickens roosting in a tree;\n",
      "a drowsy hen would step on to the comfortable board, softly clucking her\n",
      "gratitude, and the prowler would dump her into his bag, and later into\n",
      "his stomach, perfectly sure that in taking this trifle from the man who\n",
      "daily robbed him of an inestimable treasure--his liberty--he was not\n",

      "kissed his feet, declaring that they would never forget his goodness and\n",
      "never cease to pray for him as long as they lived. They were sincere,\n",
      "for like a god he had stretched forth his mighty hand and closed the\n",
      "gates of hell against them. He knew, himself, that he had done a noble\n",

      "was able to think of him with serenity. She put the vile side of him out\n",
      "of her mind, and dwelt only on recollections of his occasional acts of\n",
      "kindness to her. She gilded and otherwise decorated these, and made them\n",
      "very pleasant to contemplate. She began to long to see him. She would go\n",
      "and fawn upon him, slave-like--for this would have to be her attitude,\n",
      "of course--and maybe she would find that time had modified him, and that\n",

      "hunted sense and a hunted look, and then he fled away to the hill-tops\n",

      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He dreaded his meals; the \"nigger\" in him was ashamed to sit at the\n",

      "habits had taken on the appearance of complete change, but after a while\n",
      "with the subsidence of the storm both began to settle toward their\n",
      "former places. He dropped gradually back into his old frivolous and\n",
      "easy-going ways and conditions of feeling and manner of speech, and no\n",

      "somebody to rule over, and he was better than nothing. Her strong\n",
      "character and aggressive and commanding ways compelled Tom's admiration\n",
      "in spite of the fact that he got more illustrations of them than he\n",
      "needed for his comfort. However, as a rule her conversation was made up\n",

      "possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "For this purpose he projected a new raid on his town. He never meddled\n",

      "acquainted with. He arrived at the haunted house in disguise on the\n",
      "Wednesday before the advent of the twins--after writing his aunt Pratt\n",
      "that he would not arrive until two days after--and lay in hiding there\n",
      "with his mother until toward daylight Friday morning, when he went to\n",
      "his uncle's house and entered by the back way with his own key, and\n",
      "slipped up to his room, where he could have the use of the mirror and\n",
      "toilet articles. He had a suit of girl's clothes with him in a bundle as\n",
      "a disguise for his raid, and was wearing a suit of his mother's\n",
      "clothing, with black gloves and veil. By dawn he was tricked out for his\n",
      "raid, but he caught a glimpse of Pudd'nhead Wilson through the window\n",
      "over the way, and knew that Pudd'nhead had caught a glimpse of him. So\n",
      "he entertained Wilson with some airs and graces and attitudes for a\n",

      "himself about a humble old woman leaving a neighbor's house by the back\n",
      "way in the early morning, in case he was still spying. But supposing\n",
      "Wilson had seen him leave, and had thought it suspicious, and had also\n",
      "followed him? The thought made Tom cold. He gave up the raid for the\n",
      "day, and hurried back to the haunted house by the obscurest route he\n",
      "knew. His mother was gone; but she came back, by and by, with the news\n",
      "of the grand reception at Patsy Cooper's, and soon persuaded him that\n",
      "the opportunity was like a special providence, it was so inviting and\n",
      "perfect. So he went raiding, after all, and made a nice success of it\n",
      "while everybody was gone to Patsy Cooper's. Success gave him nerve and\n",
      "even actual intrepidity; insomuch, indeed, that after he had conveyed\n",
      "his harvest to his mother in a back alley, he went to the reception\n",

      "There are three infallible ways of pleasing an author, and the three\n",
      "form a rising scale of compliment: 1, to tell him you have read one of\n",
      "his books; 2, to tell him you have read all of his books; 3, to ask him\n",
      "to let you read the manuscript of his forthcoming book. No. 1 admits you\n",
      "to his respect; No. 2 admits you to his admiration; No. 3 carries you\n",

      "As to the Adjective: when in doubt, strike it out.--Pudd'nhead Wilson's\n",
      "Calendar.\n",

      "The twins arrived presently, and talk began. It flowed along chattily\n",
      "and sociably, and under its influence the new friendship gathered ease\n",
      "and strength. Wilson got out his Calendar, by request, and read a\n",
      "passage or two from it, which the twins praised quite cordially. This\n",
      "pleased the author so much that he complied gladly when they asked him\n",
      "to lend them a batch of the work to read at home. In the course of their\n",
      "wide travels they had found out that there are three sure ways of\n",
      "pleasing an author; they were now working the best of the three.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an interruption, now. Young Tom Driscoll appeared, and joined\n",
      "the party. He pretended to be seeing the distinguished strangers for the\n",
      "first time when they rose to shake hands; but this was only a blind, as\n",
      "he had already had a glimpse of them, at the reception, while robbing\n",
      "the house. The twins made mental note that he was smooth-faced and\n",
      "rather handsome, and smooth and undulatory in his movements--graceful,\n",
      "in fact. Angelo thought he had a good eye; Luigi thought there was\n",
      "something veiled and sly about it. Angelo thought he had a pleasant\n",
      "free-and-easy way of talking; Luigi thought it was more so than was\n",
      "agreeable. Angelo thought he was a sufficiently nice young man; Luigi\n",
      "reserved his decision. Tom's first contribution to the conversation was\n",
      "a question which he had put to Wilson a hundred times before. It was\n",
      "always cheerily and good-naturedly put, and always inflicted a little\n",
      "pang, for it touched a secret sore; but this time the pang was sharp,\n",
      "since strangers were present.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, how does the law come on? Had a case yet?\"\n",

      "Wilson bit his lip, but answered, \"No--not yet,\" with as much\n",
      "indifference as he could assume. Judge Driscoll had generously left the\n",
      "law feature out of the Wilson biography which he had furnished to the\n",
      "twins. Young Tom laughed pleasantly, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wilson's a lawyer, gentlemen, but he doesn't practise now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The sarcasm bit, but Wilson kept himself under control, and said without\n",
      "passion:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't practise, it is true. It is true that I have never had a case,\n",
      "and have had to earn a poor living for twenty years as an expert\n",
      "accountant in a town where I can't get hold of a set of books to\n",
      "untangle as often as I should like. But it is also true that I did fit\n",
      "myself well for the practice of the law. By the time I was your age,\n",
      "Tom, I had chosen a profession, and was soon competent to enter upon\n",
      "it.\" Tom winced. \"I never got a chance to try my hand at it, and I may\n",
      "never get a chance; and yet if I ever do get it I shall be found ready,\n",
      "for I have kept up my law-studies all these years.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's it; that's good grit! I like to see it. I've a notion to throw\n",
      "all my business your way. My business and your law-practice ought to\n",
      "make a pretty gay team, Dave,\" and the young fellow laughed again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you will throw--\" Wilson had thought of the girl in Tom's bedroom,\n",
      "and was going to say, \"If you will throw the surreptitious and\n",
      "disreputable part of your business my way, it may amount to something;\"\n",
      "but thought better of it and said, \"However, this matter doesn't fit\n",
      "well in a general conversation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, we'll change the subject; I guess you were about to give me\n",
      "another dig, anyway, so I'm willing to change. How's the Awful Mystery\n",
      "flourishing these days? Wilson's got a scheme for driving plain\n",
      "window-glass out of the market by decorating it with greasy\n",
      "finger-marks, and getting rich by selling it at famine prices to the\n",
      "crowned heads over in Europe to outfit their palaces with. Fetch it out,\n",
      "Dave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson brought three of his glass strips, and said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I get the subject to pass the fingers of his right hand through his\n",
      "hair, so as to get a little coating of the natural oil on them, and then\n",
      "press the balls of them on the glass. A fine and delicate print of the\n",
      "lines in the skin results, and is permanent, if it doesn't come in\n",
      "contact with something able to rub it off. You begin, Tom.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, I think you took my finger-marks once or twice before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; but you were a little boy the last time, only about twelve years\n",
      "old.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's so. Of course I've changed entirely since then, and variety is\n",
      "what the crowned heads want, I guess.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed his fingers through his crop of short hair, and pressed them\n",
      "one at a time on the glass. Angelo made a print of his fingers on\n",
      "another glass, and Luigi followed with the third. Wilson marked the\n",
      "glasses with names and date, and put them away. Tom gave one of his\n",
      "little laughs, and said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought I wouldn't say anything, but if variety is what you are\n",
      "after, you have wasted a piece of glass. The hand-print of one twin is\n",
      "the same as the hand-print of the fellow-twin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it's done now, and I like to have them both, anyway,\" said\n",
      "Wilson, returning to his place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But look here, Dave,\" said Tom, \"you used to tell people's fortunes,\n",
      "too, when you took their finger-marks. Dave's just an all-round\n",
      "genius--a genius of the first water, gentlemen; a great scientist\n",
      "running to seed here in this village, a prophet with the kind of honor\n",
      "that prophets generally get at home--for here they don't give shucks for\n",
      "his scientifics, and they call his skull a notion-factory--hey, Dave,\n",
      "ain't it so? But never mind; he'll make his mark some day--finger-mark,\n",
      "you know, he-he! But really, you want to let him take a shy at your\n",
      "palms once; it's worth twice the price of admission or your money's\n",
      "returned at the door. Why, he'll read your wrinkles as easy as a book,\n",
      "and not only tell you fifty or sixty things that's going to happen to\n",
      "you, but fifty or sixty thousand that ain't. Come, Dave, show the\n",
      "gentlemen what an inspired Jack-at-all-science we've got in this town,\n",
      "and don't know it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson winced under this nagging and not very courteous chaff, and the\n",
      "twins suffered with him and for him. They rightly judged, now, that the\n",
      "best way to relieve him would be to take the thing in earnest and treat\n",
      "it with respect, ignoring Tom's rather overdone raillery; so Luigi\n",
      "said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have seen something of palmistry in our wanderings, and know very\n",
      "well what astonishing things it can do. If it isn't a science, and one\n",
      "of the greatest of them, too, I don't know what its other name ought to\n",
      "be. In the Orient--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom looked surprised and incredulous. He said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That juggling a science? But really, you ain't serious, are you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, entirely so. Four years ago we had our hands read out to us as if\n",
      "our palms had been covered with print.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, do you mean to say there was actually anything in it?\" asked Tom,\n",
      "his incredulity beginning to weaken a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There was this much in it,\" said Angelo: \"what was told us of our\n",
      "characters was minutely exact--we could not have bettered it ourselves.\n",
      "Next, two or three memorable things that had happened to us were laid\n",
      "bare--things which no one present but ourselves could have known about.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, it's rank sorcery!\" exclaimed Tom, who was now becoming very much\n",
      "interested. \"And how did they make out with what was going to happen to\n",
      "you in the future?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On the whole, quite fairly,\" said Luigi. \"Two or three of the most\n",
      "striking things foretold have happened since; much the most striking one\n",
      "of all happened within that same year. Some of the minor prophecies have\n",
      "come true; some of the minor and some of the major ones have not been\n",
      "fulfilled yet, and of course may never be: still, I should be more\n",
      "surprised if they failed to arrive than if they didn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was entirely sobered, and profoundly impressed. He said,\n",
      "apologetically--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dave, I wasn't meaning to belittle that science; I was only\n",
      "chaffing--chattering, I reckon I'd better say. I wish you would look at\n",
      "their palms. Come, won't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why certainly, if you want me to; but you know I've had no chance to\n",
      "become an expert, and don't claim to be one. When a past event is\n",
      "somewhat prominently recorded in the palm I can generally detect that,\n",
      "but minor ones often escape me,--not always, of course, but often,--but\n",
      "I haven't much confidence in myself when it comes to reading the future.\n",
      "I am talking as if palmistry was a daily study with me, but that is not\n",
      "so. I haven't examined half a dozen hands in the last half dozen years;\n",
      "you see, the people got to joking about it, and I stopped to let the\n",
      "talk die down. I'll tell you what we'll do, Count Luigi: I'll make a try\n",
      "at your past, and if I have any success there--no, on the whole, I'll\n",
      "let the future alone; that's really the affair of an expert.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took Luigi's hand. Tom said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait--don't look yet, Dave! Count Luigi, here's paper and pencil. Set\n",
      "down that thing that you said was the most striking one that was\n",
      "foretold to you, and happened less than a year afterward, and give it to\n",
      "me so I can see if Dave finds it in your hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Luigi wrote a line privately, and folded up the piece of paper, and\n",
      "handed it to Tom, saying--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you when to look at it, if he finds it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson began to study Luigi's palm, tracing life lines, heart lines,\n",
      "head lines, and so on, and noting carefully their relations with the\n",
      "cobweb of finer and more delicate marks and lines that enmeshed them on\n",
      "all sides; he felt of the fleshy cushion at the base of the thumb, and\n",
      "noted its shape; he felt of the fleshy side of the hand between the\n",
      "wrist and the base of the little finger, and noted its shape also; he\n",
      "painstakingly examined the fingers, observing their form, proportions,\n",
      "and natural manner of disposing themselves when in repose. All this\n",
      "process was watched by the three spectators with absorbing interest,\n",
      "their heads bent together over Luigi's palm, and nobody disturbing the\n",
      "stillness with a word. Wilson now entered upon a close survey of the\n",
      "palm again, and his revelations began.\n",
      "\n",
      "He mapped out Luigi's character and disposition, his tastes, aversions,\n",
      "proclivities, ambitions, and eccentricities in a way which sometimes\n",
      "made Luigi wince and the others laugh, but both twins declared that the\n",
      "chart was artistically drawn and was correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, Wilson took up Luigi's history. He proceeded cautiously and with\n",
      "hesitation, now, moving his finger slowly along the great lines of the\n",
      "palm, and now and then halting it at a \"star\" or some such landmark, and\n",
      "examining that neighborhood minutely. He proclaimed one or two past\n",
      "events, Luigi confirmed his correctness, and the search went on.\n",
      "Presently Wilson glanced up suddenly with a surprised expression--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here is a record of an incident which you would perhaps not wish me\n",
      "to--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bring it out,\" said Luigi, good-naturedly; \"I promise you it sha'n't\n",
      "embarrass me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Wilson still hesitated, and did not seem quite to know what to do.\n",
      "Then he said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think it is too delicate a matter to--to--I believe I would rather\n",
      "write it or whisper it to you, and let you decide for yourself whether\n",
      "you want it talked out or not.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That will answer,\" said Luigi; \"write it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson wrote something on a slip of paper and handed it to Luigi, who\n",
      "read it to himself and said to Tom--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Unfold your slip and read it, Mr. Driscoll.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom read:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It was prophesied that I would kill a man. It came true before the year\n",
      "was out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom added, \"Great Scott!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Luigi handed Wilson's paper to Tom, and said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now read this one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom read:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You have killed some one, but whether man, woman or child, I do not\n",
      "make out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Cæsar's ghost!\" commented Tom, with astonishment. \"It beats anything\n",
      "that was ever heard of! Why, a man's own hand is his deadliest enemy!\n",
      "Just think of that--a man's own hand keeps a record of the deepest and\n",
      "fatalest secrets of his life, and is treacherously ready to expose him\n",
      "to any black-magic stranger that comes along. But what do you let a\n",
      "person look at your hand for, with that awful thing printed on it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" said Luigi, reposefully, \"I don't mind it. I killed the man for\n",
      "good reasons, and I don't regret it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What were the reasons?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, he needed killing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you why he did it, since he won't say himself,\" said Angelo,\n",
      "warmly. \"He did it to save my life, that's what he did it for. So it was\n",
      "a noble act, and not a thing to be hid in the dark.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it was, so it was,\" said Wilson; \"to do such a thing to save a\n",
      "brother's life is a great and fine action.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now come,\" said Luigi, \"it is very pleasant to hear you say these\n",
      "things, but for unselfishness, or heroism, or magnanimity, the\n",
      "circumstances won't stand scrutiny. You overlook one detail; suppose I\n",
      "hadn't saved Angelo's life, what would have become of mine? If I had let\n",
      "the man kill him, wouldn't he have killed me, too? I saved my own life,\n",
      "you see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, that is your way of talking,\" said Angelo, \"but I know you--I\n",
      "don't believe you thought of yourself at all. I keep that weapon yet\n",
      "that Luigi killed the man with, and I'll show it to you sometime. That\n",
      "incident makes it interesting, and it had a history before it came into\n",
      "Luigi's hands which adds to its interest. It was given to Luigi by a\n",
      "great Indian prince, the Gaikowar of Baroda, and it had been in his\n",
      "family two or three centuries. It killed a good many disagreeable people\n",
      "who troubled that hearthstone at one time and another. It isn't much too\n",
      "look at, except that it isn't shaped like other knives, or dirks, or\n",
      "whatever it may be called--here, I'll draw it for you.\" He took a sheet\n",
      "of paper and made a rapid sketch. \"There it is--a broad and murderous\n",
      "blade, with edges like a razor for sharpness. The devices engraved on it\n",
      "are the ciphers or names of its long line of possessors--I had Luigi's\n",
      "name added in Roman letters myself with our coat of arms, as you see.\n",
      "You notice what a curious handle the thing has. It is solid ivory,\n",
      "polished like a mirror, and is four or five inches long--round, and as\n",
      "thick as a large man's wrist, with the end squared off flat, for your\n",
      "thumb to rest on; for you grasp it, with your thumb resting on the blunt\n",
      "end--so--and lift it aloft and strike downward. The Gaikowar showed us\n",
      "how the thing was done when he gave it to Luigi, and before that night\n",
      "was ended Luigi had used the knife, and the Gaikowar was a man short by\n",
      "reason of it. The sheath is magnificently ornamented with gems of great\n",
      "value. You will find the sheath more worth looking at than the knife\n",
      "itself, of course.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom said to himself--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's lucky I came here. I would have sold that knife for a song; I\n",
      "supposed the jewels were glass.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But go on; don't stop,\" said Wilson. \"Our curiosity is up now, to hear\n",
      "about the homicide. Tell us about that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, briefly, the knife was to blame for that, all around. A native\n",
      "servant slipped into our room in the palace in the night, to kill us and\n",
      "steal the knife on account of the fortune incrusted on its sheath,\n",
      "without a doubt. Luigi had it under his pillow; we were in bed together.\n",
      "There was a dim night-light burning. I was asleep, but Luigi was awake,\n",
      "and he thought he detected a vague form nearing the bed. He slipped the\n",
      "knife out of the sheath and was ready, and unembarrassed by hampering\n",
      "bed-clothes, for the weather was hot and we hadn't any. Suddenly that\n",
      "native rose at the bedside, and bent over me with his right hand lifted\n",
      "and a dirk in it aimed at my throat; but Luigi grabbed his wrist, pulled\n",
      "him downward, and drove his own knife into the man's neck. That is the\n",
      "whole story.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson and Tom drew deep breaths, and after some general chat about the\n",
      "tragedy, Pudd'nhead said, taking Tom's hand--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, Tom, I've never had a look at your palms, as it happens; perhaps\n",
      "you've got some little questionable privacies that need--hel-lo!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom had snatched away his hand, and was looking a good deal confused.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, he's blushing!\" said Luigi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom darted an ugly look at him, and said sharply--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, if I am, it ain't because I'm a murderer!\" Luigi's dark face\n",
      "flushed, but before he could speak or move, Tom added with anxious\n",
      "haste: \"Oh, I beg a thousand pardons. I didn't mean that; it was out\n",
      "before I thought, and I'm very, very sorry--you must forgive me!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson came to the rescue, and smoothed things down as well as he could;\n",
      "and in fact was entirely successful as far as the twins were concerned,\n",
      "for they felt sorrier for the affront put upon him by his guest's\n",
      "outburst of ill manners than for the insult offered to Luigi. But the\n",
      "success was not so pronounced with the offender. Tom tried to seem at\n",
      "his ease, and he went through the motions fairly well, but at bottom he\n",
      "felt resentful toward all the three witnesses of his exhibition; in\n",
      "fact, he felt so annoyed at them for having witnessed it and noticed it\n",
      "that he almost forgot to feel annoyed at himself for placing it before\n",
      "them. However, something presently happened which made him almost\n",
      "comfortable, and brought him nearly back to a state of charity and\n",
      "friendliness. This was a little spat between the twins; not much of a\n",
      "spat, but still a spat; and before they got far with it they were in a\n",
      "decided condition of irritation with each other. Tom was charmed; so\n",
      "pleased, indeed, that he cautiously did what he could to increase the\n",
      "irritation while pretending to be actuated by more respectable motives.\n",
      "By his help the fire got warmed up to the blazing-point, and he might\n",
      "have had the happiness of seeing the flames show up, in another moment,\n",
      "but for the interruption of a knock on the door--an interruption which\n",
      "fretted him as much as it gratified Wilson. Wilson opened the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The visitor was a good-natured, ignorant, energetic, middle-aged\n",
      "Irishman named John Buckstone, who was a great politician in a small\n",
      "way, and always took a large share in public matters of every sort. One\n",
      "of the town's chief excitements, just now, was over the matter of rum.\n",
      "There was a strong rum party and a strong anti-rum party. Buckstone was\n",
      "training with the rum party, and he had been sent to hunt up the twins\n",
      "and invite them to attend a mass-meeting of that faction. He delivered\n",
      "his errand, and said the clans were already gathering in the big hall\n",
      "over the market-house. Luigi accepted the invitation cordially, Angelo\n",
      "less cordially, since he disliked crowds, and did not drink the powerful\n",
      "intoxicants of America. In fact, he was even a teetotaler\n",
      "sometimes--when it was judicious to be one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twins left with Buckstone, and Tom Driscoll joined company with them\n",
      "uninvited.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the distance one could see a long wavering line of torches drifting\n",
      "down the main street, and could hear the throbbing of the bass drum, the\n",
      "clash of cymbals, the squeaking of a fife or two, and the faint roar of\n",
      "remote hurrahs. The tail-end of this procession was climbing the\n",
      "market-house stairs when the twins arrived in its neighborhood; when\n",
      "they reached the hall it was full of people, torches, smoke, noise and\n",
      "enthusiasm. They were conducted to the platform by Buckstone--Tom\n",
      "Driscoll still following--and were delivered to the chairman in the\n",
      "midst of a prodigious explosion of welcome. When the noise had moderated\n",
      "a little, the chair proposed that \"our illustrious guests be at once\n",
      "elected, by complimentary acclamation, to membership in our\n",
      "ever-glorious organization, the paradise of the free and the perdition\n",
      "of the slave.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This eloquent discharge opened the flood-gates of enthusiasm again, and\n",
      "the election was carried with thundering unanimity. Then arose a storm\n",
      "of cries:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wet them down! Wet them down! Give them a drink!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Glasses of whisky were handed to the twins. Luigi waved his aloft, then\n",
      "brought it to his lips; but Angelo set his down. There was another storm\n",
      "of cries:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter with the other one?\" \"What is the blond one going\n",
      "back on us for?\" \"Explain! Explain!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The chairman inquired, and then reported--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We have made an unfortunate mistake, gentlemen. I find that the Count\n",
      "Angelo Capello is opposed to our creed--is a teetotaler, in fact, and\n",
      "was not intending to apply for membership with us. He desires that we\n",
      "reconsider the vote by which he was elected. What is the pleasure of the\n",
      "house?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a general burst of laughter, plentifully accented with\n",
      "whistlings and cat-calls, but the energetic use of the gavel presently\n",
      "restored something like order. Then a man spoke from the crowd, and said\n",
      "that while he was very sorry that the mistake had been made, it would\n",
      "not be possible to rectify it at the present meeting. According to the\n",
      "by-laws it must go over to the next regular meeting for action. He would\n",
      "not offer a motion, as none was required. He desired to apologize to the\n",
      "gentleman in the name of the house, and begged to assure him that as far\n",
      "as it might lie in the power of the Sons of Liberty, his temporary\n",
      "membership in the order would be made pleasant to him.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That's the talk!\" \"He's a good fellow, anyway, if he is a teetotaler!\"\n",
      "\"Drink his health!\" \"Give him a rouser, and no heeltaps!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Glasses were handed around, and everybody on the platform drank Angelo's\n",
      "health, while the house bellowed forth in song:\n",
      "\n",
      "   For he's a jolly good fel-low,\n",
      "   For he's a jolly good fel-low,\n",
      "   For he's a jolly good fe-el-low,--\n",
      "      Which nobody can deny.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Driscoll drank. It was his second glass, for he had drunk Angelo's\n",
      "the moment that Angelo had set it down. The two drinks made him very\n",
      "merry--almost idiotically so--and he began to take a most lively and\n",
      "prominent part in the proceedings, particularly in the music and\n",
      "cat-calls and side-remarks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chairman was still standing at the front, the twins at his side. The\n",
      "extraordinarily close resemblance of the brothers to each other\n",
      "suggested a witticism to Tom Driscoll, and just as the chairman began a\n",
      "speech he skipped forward and said with an air of tipsy confidence to\n",
      "the audience--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Boys, I move that he keeps still and lets this human philopena snip you\n",
      "out a speech.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The descriptive aptness of the phrase caught the house, and a mighty\n",
      "burst of laughter followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luigi's southern blood leaped to the boiling-point in a moment under the\n",
      "sharp humiliation of this insult delivered in the presence of four\n",
      "hundred strangers. It was not in the young man's nature to let the\n",
      "matter pass, or to delay the squaring of the account. He took a couple\n",
      "of strides and halted behind the unsuspecting joker. Then he drew back\n",
      "and delivered a kick of such titanic vigor that it lifted Tom clear over\n",
      "the footlights and landed him on the heads of the front row of the Sons\n",
      "of Liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even a sober person does not like to have a human being emptied on him\n",
      "when he is not doing any harm; a person who is not sober cannot endure\n",
      "such an attention at all. The nest of Sons of Liberty that Driscoll\n",
      "landed in had not a sober bird in it; in fact there was probably not an\n",
      "entirely sober one in the auditorium. Driscoll was promptly and\n",
      "indignantly flung on to the heads of Sons in the next row, and these\n",
      "Sons passed him on toward the rear, and then immediately began to pummel\n",
      "the front-row Sons who had passed him to them. This course was strictly\n",
      "followed by bench after bench as Driscoll traveled in his tumultuous and\n",
      "airy flight toward the door; so he left behind him an ever lengthening\n",
      "wake of raging and plunging and fighting and swearing humanity. Down\n",
      "went group after group of torches, and presently above the deafening\n",
      "clatter of the gavel, roar of angry voices, and crash of succumbing\n",
      "benches, rose the paralyzing cry of \"Fire!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The fighting ceased instantly; the cursing ceased; for one distinctly\n",
      "defined moment there was a dead hush, a motionless calm, where the\n",
      "tempest had been; then with one impulse the multitude awoke to life and\n",
      "energy again, and went surging and struggling and swaying, this way and\n",
      "that, its outer edges melting away through windows and doors and\n",
      "gradually lessening the pressure and relieving the mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fire-boys were never on hand so suddenly before; for there was no\n",
      "distance to go, this time, their quarters being in the rear end of the\n",
      "market-house. There was an engine company and a hook-and-ladder company.\n",
      "Half of each was composed of rummies and the other half of anti-rummies,\n",
      "after the moral and political share-and-share-alike fashion of the\n",
      "frontier town of the period. Enough anti-rummies were loafing in\n",
      "quarters to man the engine and the ladders. In two minutes they had\n",
      "their red shirts and helmets on--they never stirred officially in\n",
      "unofficial costume--and as the mass meeting overhead smashed through the\n",
      "long row of windows and poured out upon the roof of the arcade, the\n",
      "deliverers were ready for them with a powerful stream of water which\n",
      "washed some of them off the roof and nearly drowned the rest. But water\n",
      "was preferable to fire, and still the stampede from the windows\n",
      "continued, and still the pitiless drenching assailed it until the\n",
      "building was empty; then the fire-boys mounted to the hall and flooded\n",
      "it with water enough to annihilate forty times as much fire as there was\n",
      "there; for a village fire-company does not often get a chance to show\n",
      "off, and so when it does get a chance it makes the most of it. Such\n",

      "friend Pembroke Howard. These two had been boys together in Virginia\n",
      "when that State still ranked as the chief and most imposing member of\n",
      "the Union, and they still coupled the proud and affectionate adjective\n",
      "\"old\" with her name when they spoke of her. In Missouri a recognized\n",
      "superiority attached to any person who hailed from Old Virginia; and\n",
      "this superiority was exalted to supremacy when a person of such nativity\n",

      "as clearly defined and as strict as any that could be found among the\n",
      "printed statutes of the land. The F. F. V. was born a gentleman; his\n",
      "highest duty in life was to watch over that great inheritance and keep\n",
      "it unsmirched. He must keep his honor spotless. Those laws were his\n",

      "as half a point of the compass it meant shipwreck to his honor; that is\n",

      "uncle's favor and persuade him to reconstruct once more that generous\n",

      "reposeful, and so also was the voice that answered:\n",

      "he would have begun yesterday, for he was just in the humor for it. He\n",

      "came home he couldn't find his father's old silver watch that don't keep\n",
      "time and he thinks so much of, and couldn't remember what he did with it\n",
      "three or four days ago when he saw it last, and so when I arrived he was\n",
      "all in a sweat about it, and when I suggested that it probably wasn't\n",
      "lost but stolen, it put him in a regular passion and he said I was a\n",
      "fool--which convinced me, without any trouble, that that was just what\n",
      "he was afraid had happened, himself, but did not want to believe it,\n",
      "because lost things stand a better chance of being found again than\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You'll find it stolen--that's what you'll find.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, I sha'n't; for when I suggested theft about the watch and got such\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You are sure you missed nothing else?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, nothing of consequence. I missed a small plain gold ring worth\n",
      "two or three dollars, but that will turn up. I'll look again.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Mr. Justice Robinson entered, followed by Buckstone and the\n",

      "gold ring.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it is a bad business,\" said the Justice, \"and gets worse the\n",

      "the Grangers, the Hales, the Fullers, the Holcombs, in fact everybody\n",
      "that lives around about Patsy Cooper's has been robbed of little things\n",
      "like trinkets and teaspoons and such-like small valuables that are\n",
      "easily carried off. It's perfectly plain that the thief took advantage\n",
      "of the reception at Patsy Cooper's when all the neighbors were in her\n",
      "house and all their niggers hanging around her fence for a look at the\n",
      "show, to raid the vacant houses undisturbed. Patsy is miserable about\n",
      "it; miserable on account of the neighbors, and particularly miserable on\n",
      "account of her foreigners, of course; so miserable on their account that\n",
      "she hasn't any room to worry about her own little losses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's the same old raider,\" said Wilson. \"I suppose there isn't any\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Constable Blake doesn't think so.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, you're wrong there,\" said Blake; \"the other times it was a man;\n",
      "there was plenty of signs of that, as we know, in the profession, though\n",
      "we never got hands on him; but this time it's a woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson thought of the mysterious girl straight off. She was always in\n",
      "his mind now. But she failed him again. Blake continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"She's a stoop-shouldered old woman with a covered basket on her arm, in\n",
      "a black veil, dressed in mourning. I saw her going aboard the ferry-boat\n",
      "yesterday. Lives in Illinois, I reckon; but I don't care where she\n",
      "lives, I'm going to get her--she can make herself sure of that.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What makes you think she's the thief?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, there ain't any other, for one thing; and for another, some\n",
      "nigger draymen that happened to be driving along saw her coming out of\n",
      "or going into houses, and told me so--and it just happens that they was\n",
      "robbed houses, every time.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was granted that this was plenty good enough circumstantial evidence.\n",
      "A pensive silence followed, which lasted some moments, then Wilson\n",
      "said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's one good thing, anyway. She can't either pawn or sell Count\n",
      "Luigi's costly Indian dagger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My!\" said Tom, \"is that gone?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, that was a haul! But why can't she pawn it or sell it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Because when the twins went home from the Sons of Liberty meeting last\n",
      "night, news of the raid was sifting in from everywhere, and Aunt Patsy\n",
      "was in distress to know if they had lost anything. They found that the\n",
      "dagger was gone, and they notified the police and pawnbrokers\n",
      "everywhere. It was a great haul, yes, but the old woman won't get\n",
      "anything out of it, because she'll get caught.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did they offer a reward?\" asked Buckstone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes; five hundred dollars for the knife, and five hundred more for the\n",
      "thief.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What a leather-headed idea!\" exclaimed the constable. \"The thief\n",
      "da'sn't go near them, nor send anybody. Whoever goes is going to get\n",
      "himself nabbed, for their ain't any pawnbroker that's going to lose the\n",
      "chance to--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If anybody had noticed Tom's face at that time, the gray-green color of\n",
      "it might have provoked curiosity; but nobody did. He said to himself:\n",
      "\"I'm gone! I never can square up; the rest of the plunder won't pawn or\n",
      "sell for half of the bill. Oh, I know it--I'm gone, I'm gone--and this\n",
      "time it's for good. Oh, this is awful--I don't know what to do, nor\n",
      "which way to turn!\"\n",

      "There were strong signs of a general curiosity, and Buckstone said--\n",

      "that if you don't mind telling us in confidence--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I'd as soon tell as not, Buckstone, but as long as the twins and I\n",
      "agreed to say nothing about it, we must let it stand so. But you can\n",
      "take my word for it you won't be kept waiting three days. Somebody will\n",
      "apply for that reward pretty promptly, and I'll show you the thief and\n",
      "the dagger both very soon afterward.\"\n",

      "The constable was disappointed, and also perplexed. He said--\n",

      "The subject seemed about talked out. Nobody seemed to have anything\n",
      "further to offer. After a silence the justice of the peace informed\n",
      "Wilson that he and Buckstone and the constable had come as a committee,\n",
      "on the part of the Democratic party, to ask him to run for mayor--for\n",
      "the little town was about to become a city and the first charter\n",
      "election was approaching. It was the first attention which Wilson had\n",
      "ever received at the hands of any party; it was a sufficiently humble\n",
      "one, but it was a recognition of his début into the town's life and\n",
      "activities at last; it was a step upward, and he was deeply gratified.\n",

      "finally he said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This may be my last night in the world--I must not take the chance. He\n",
      "is worthless and unworthy, but it is largely my fault. He was intrusted\n",
      "to me by my brother on his dying bed, and I have indulged him to his\n",
      "hurt, instead of training him up severely, and making a man of him. I\n",
      "have violated my trust, and I must not add the sin of desertion to that.\n",
      "I have forgiven him once already, and would subject him to a long and\n",
      "hard trial before forgiving him again, if I could live; but I must not\n",
      "run that risk. No, I must restore the will. But if I survive the duel, I\n",
      "will hide it away, and he will not know, and I will not tell him until\n",
      "he reforms, and I see that his reformation is going to be permanent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He re-drew the will, and his ostensible nephew was heir to a fortune\n",
      "again. As he was finishing his task, Tom, wearied with another brooding\n",
      "tramp, entered the house and went tiptoeing past the sitting-room door.\n",
      "He glanced in, and hurried on, for the sight of his uncle had nothing\n",
      "but terrors for him to-night. But his uncle was writing! That was\n",
      "unusual at this late hour. What could he be writing? A chill of anxiety\n",
      "settled down upon Tom's heart. Did that writing concern him? He was\n",
      "afraid so. He reflected that when ill luck begins, it does not come in\n",
      "sprinkles, but in showers. He said he would get a glimpse of that\n",
      "document or know the reason why. He heard some one coming, and stepped\n",
      "out of sight and hearing. It was Pembroke Howard. What could be\n",
      "hatching?\n",

      "In another minute the will was in Tom's hands. His misery vanished, his\n",
      "feelings underwent a tremendous revulsion. He put the will carefully\n",
      "back in its place, and spread his mouth and swung his hat once, twice,\n",
      "three times around his head, in imitation of three rousing huzzas, no\n",
      "sound issuing from his lips. He fell to communing with himself excitedly\n",
      "and joyously, but every now and then he let off another volley of dumb\n",
      "hurrahs.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said to himself: \"I've got the fortune again, but I'll not let on\n",
      "that I know about it. And this time I'm going to hang on to it. I take\n",
      "no more risks. I'll gamble no more, I'll drink no more, because--well,\n",
      "because I'll not go where there is any of that sort of thing going on,\n",
      "again. It's the sure way, and the only sure way; I might have thought of\n",
      "that sooner--well, yes, if I had wanted to. But now--dear me, I've had a\n",
      "scare this time, and I'll take no more chances. Not a single chance\n",
      "more. Land! I persuaded myself this evening that I could fetch him\n",
      "around without any great amount of effort, but I've been getting more\n",
      "and more heavy-hearted and doubtful straight along, ever since. If he\n",
      "tells me about this thing, all right; but if he doesn't, I sha'n't let\n",
      "on. I--well, I'd like to tell Pudd'nhead Wilson, but--no, I'll think\n",
      "about that; perhaps I won't.\" He whirled off another dead huzza, and\n",
      "said, \"I'm reformed, and this time I'll stay so, sure!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He was about to close with a final grand silent demonstration, when he\n",
      "suddenly recollected that Wilson had put it out of his power to pawn or\n",
      "sell the Indian knife, and that he was once more in awful peril of\n",
      "exposure by his creditors for that reason. His joy collapsed utterly,\n",
      "and he turned away and moped toward the door moaning and lamenting over\n",
      "the bitterness of his luck. He dragged himself up-stairs, and brooded in\n",
      "his room a long time disconsolate and forlorn, with Luigi's Indian knife\n",
      "for a text. At last he sighed and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"When I supposed these stones were glass and this ivory bone, the thing\n",
      "hadn't any interest for me because it hadn't any value, and couldn't\n",
      "help me out of my trouble. But now--why, now it is full of interest;\n",
      "yes, and of a sort to break a body's heart. It's a bag of gold that has\n",
      "turned to dirt and ashes in my hands. It could save me, and save me so\n",
      "easily, and yet I've got to go to ruin. It's like drowning with a\n",
      "life-preserver in my reach. All the hard luck comes to me, and all the\n",
      "good luck goes to other people--Pudd'nhead Wilson, for instance; even\n",
      "his career has got a sort of a little start at last, and what has he\n",
      "done to deserve it, I should like to know? Yes, he has opened his own\n",
      "road, but he isn't content with that, but must block mine. It's a\n",
      "sordid, selfish world, and I wish I was out of it.\" He allowed the light\n",
      "of the candle to play upon the jewels of the sheath, but the flashings\n",
      "and sparklings had no charm for his eye; they were only just so many\n",
      "pangs to his heart. \"I must not say anything to Roxy about this thing,\"\n",
      "he said, \"she is too daring. She would be for digging these stones out\n",
      "and selling them, and then--why, she would be arrested and the stones\n",
      "traced, and then--\" The thought made him quake, and he hid the knife\n",
      "away, trembling all over and glancing furtively about, like a criminal\n",
      "who fancies that the accuser is already at hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should he try to sleep? Oh, no, sleep was not for him; his trouble was\n",
      "too haunting, too afflicting for that. He must have somebody to mourn\n",
      "with. He would carry his despair to Roxy.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had heard several distant gunshots, but that sort of thing was not\n",
      "uncommon, and they had made no impression upon him. He went out at the\n",
      "back door, and turned westward. He passed Wilson's house and proceeded\n",
      "along the lane, and presently saw several figures approaching Wilson's\n",
      "place through the vacant lots. These were the duelists returning from\n",
      "the fight; he thought he recognized them, but as he had no desire for\n",
      "white people's company, he stooped down behind the fence until they were\n",
      "out of his way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roxy was feeling fine. She said:\n",

      "find that he had a coward in his family. He glanced up at last, and got\n",
      "a shock himself. Roxana's bosom was heaving with suppressed passion, and\n",

      "the time that no thief and no thief's pal was going to try to pawn or\n",

      "\"Well,\" said the constable, pensively, \"I had the idea that it wouldn't\n",

      "head a chance at it. He made up a supposititious case, and laid it\n",
      "before her. She thought it over, and delivered her verdict upon it. Tom\n",
      "said to himself, \"She's hit it, sure!\" He thought he would test that\n",
      "verdict, now, and watch Wilson's face; so he said reflectively--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wilson, you're not a fool--a fact of recent discovery. Whatever your\n",
      "scheme was, it had sense in it, Blake's opinion to the contrary\n",
      "notwithstanding. I don't ask you to reveal it, but I will suppose a\n",
      "case--a case which will answer as a starting-point for the real thing I\n",
      "am going to come at, and that's all I want. You offered five hundred\n",
      "dollars for the knife, and five hundred for the thief. We will suppose,\n",
      "for argument's sake, that the first reward is advertised and the second\n",
      "offered by private letter to pawnbrokers and--\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Blake slapped his thigh, and cried out--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By Jackson, he's got you, Pudd'nhead! Now why couldn't I or any fool\n",
      "have thought of that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson said to himself, \"Anybody with a reasonably good head would have\n",
      "thought of it. I am not surprised that Blake didn't detect it; I am only\n",
      "surprised that Tom did. There is more to him than I supposed.\" He said\n",
      "nothing aloud, and Tom went on:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well. The thief would not suspect that there was a trap, and he\n",
      "would bring or send the knife, and say he bought it for a song, or found\n",
      "it in the road, or something like that, and try to collect the reward,\n",

      "\n",

      "\"Why, that there isn't any such knife.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Wilson's blood warmed a little, and he wondered if he had been played\n",
      "upon by those strangers; it certainly had something of that look. But\n",
      "what could they gain by it? He threw out that suggestion. Tom replied:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Gain? Oh, nothing that you would value, maybe. But they are strangers\n",

      "pets of an Oriental prince--at no expense? Is it nothing to them to be\n",
      "able to dazzle this poor little town with thousand-dollar rewards--at no\n",
      "expense? Wilson, there isn't any such knife, or your scheme would have\n",
      "fetched it to light. Or if there is any such knife, they've got it yet.\n",
      "I believe, myself, that they've seen such a knife, for Angelo pictured\n",
      "it out with his pencil too swiftly and handily for him to have been\n",
      "inventing it, and of course I can't swear that they've never had it; but\n",
      "this I'll go bail for--if they had it when they came to this town,\n",
      "they've got it yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Blake said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It looks mighty reasonable, the way Tom puts it; it most certainly\n",
      "does.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom responded, turning to leave--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You find the old woman, Blake, and if she can't furnish the knife, go\n",
      "and search the twins!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom sauntered away. Wilson felt a good deal depressed. He hardly knew\n",
      "what to think. He was loath to withdraw his faith from the twins, and\n",
      "was resolved not to do it on the present indecisive evidence; but--well,\n",
      "he would think, and then decide how to act.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blake, what do you think of this matter?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, Pudd'nhead, I'm bound to say I put it up the way Tom does. They\n",
      "hadn't the knife; or if they had it, they've got it yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The men parted. Wilson said to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe they had it; if it had been stolen, the scheme would have\n",
      "restored it, that is certain. And so I believe they've got it yet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom had no purpose in his mind when he encountered those two men. When\n",
      "he began his talk he hoped to be able to gall them a little and get a\n",
      "trifle of malicious entertainment out of it. But when he left, he left\n",
      "in great spirits, for he perceived that just by pure luck and no\n",
      "troublesome labor he had accomplished several delightful things: he had\n",
      "touched both men on a raw spot and seen them squirm; he had modified\n",
      "Wilson's sweetness for the twins with one small bitter taste that he\n",
      "wouldn't be able to get out of his mouth right away; and, best of all,\n",
      "he had taken the hated twins down a peg with the community; for Blake\n",
      "would gossip around freely, after the manner of detectives, and within a\n",
      "week the town would be laughing at them in its sleeve for offering a\n",
      "gaudy reward for a bauble which they either never possessed or hadn't\n",
      "lost. Tom was very well satisfied with himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom's behavior at home had been perfect during the entire week. His\n",
      "uncle and aunt had seen nothing like it before. They could find no fault\n",
      "with him anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Saturday evening he said to the Judge--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've had something preying on my mind, uncle, and as I am going away,\n",
      "and might never see you again, I can't bear it any longer. I made you\n",
      "believe I was afraid to fight that Italian adventurer. I had to get out\n",
      "of it on some pretext or other, and maybe I chose badly, being taken\n",
      "unawares, but no honorable person could consent to meet him in the\n",
      "field, knowing what I knew about him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Indeed? What was that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Count Luigi is a confessed assassin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Incredible!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's perfectly true. Wilson detected it in his hand, by palmistry, and\n",
      "charged him with it, and cornered him up so close that he had to\n",
      "confess; but both twins begged us on their knees to keep the secret, and\n",
      "swore they would lead straight lives here; and it was all so pitiful\n",
      "that we gave our word of honor never to expose them while they kept that\n",
      "promise. You would have done it yourself, uncle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are right, my boy; I would. A man's secret is still his own\n",
      "property, and sacred, when it has been surprised out of him like that.\n",
      "You did well, and I am proud of you.\" Then he added mournfully, \"But I\n",
      "wish I could have been saved the shame of meeting an assassin on the\n",
      "field of honor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It couldn't be helped, uncle. If I had known you were going to\n",
      "challenge him I should have felt obliged to sacrifice my pledged word in\n",
      "order to stop it, but Wilson couldn't be expected to do otherwise than\n",
      "keep silent.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, no; Wilson did right, and is in no way to blame. Tom, Tom, you have\n",
      "lifted a heavy load from my heart; I was stung to the very soul when I\n",
      "seemed to have discovered that I had a coward in my family.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may imagine what it cost me to assume such a part, uncle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, I know it, poor boy, I know it. And I can understand how much it\n",
      "has cost you to remain under that unjust stigma to this time. But it is\n",
      "all right now, and no harm is done. You have restored my comfort of\n",
      "mind, and with it your own; and both of us had suffered enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The old man sat awhile plunged in thought; then he looked up with a\n",
      "satisfied light in his eye, and said: \"That this assassin should have\n",
      "put the affront upon me of letting me meet him on the field of honor as\n",
      "if he were a gentleman is a matter which I will presently settle--but\n",
      "not now. I will not shoot him until after election. I see a way to ruin\n",
      "them both before; I will attend to that first. Neither of them shall be\n",
      "elected, that I promise. You are sure that the fact that he is an\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Perfectly certain of it, sir.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It will be a good card. I will fling a hint at it from the stump on the\n",

      "Tom Driscoll had landed at Hackett's Store, two miles below Dawson's,\n",
      "just about half an hour earlier, the only passenger for that lonely\n",
      "spot, and had walked up the shore road and entered Judge Driscoll's\n",
      "house without having encountered any one either on the road or under the\n",
      "roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "He pulled down his window-blinds and lighted his candle. He laid off his\n",
      "coat and hat and began his preparations. He unlocked his trunk and got\n",
      "his suit of girl's clothes out from under the male attire in it, and\n",
      "laid it by. Then he blacked his face with burnt cork and put the cork in\n",
      "his pocket. His plan was, to slip down to his uncle's private\n",
      "sitting-room below, pass into the bedroom, steal the safe-key from the\n",
      "old gentleman's clothes, and then go back and rob the safe. He took up\n",
      "his candle to start. His courage and confidence were high, up to this\n",
      "point, but both began to waver a little, now. Suppose he should make a\n",
      "noise, by some accident, and get caught--say, in the act of opening the\n",
      "safe? Perhaps it would be well to go armed. He took the Indian knife\n",
      "from its hiding-place, and felt a pleasant return of his wandering\n",
      "courage. He slipped stealthily down the narrow stair, his hair rising\n",
      "and his pulses halting at the slightest creak. When he was half-way\n",
      "down, he was disturbed to perceive that the landing below was touched by\n",
      "a faint glow of light. What could that mean? Was his uncle still up? No,\n",
      "that was not likely; he must have left his night-taper there when he\n",
      "went to bed. Tom crept on down, pausing at every step to listen. He\n",
      "found the door standing open, and glanced in. What he saw pleased him\n",
      "beyond measure. His uncle was asleep on the sofa; on a small table at\n",
      "the head of the sofa a lamp was burning low, and by it stood the old\n",
      "man's small tin cash-box, closed. Near the box was a pile of bank-notes\n",
      "and a piece of paper covered with figures in pencil. The safe-door was\n",
      "not open. Evidently the sleeper had wearied himself with work upon his\n",
      "finances, and was taking a rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom set his candle on the stairs, and began to make his way toward the\n",
      "pile of notes, stooping low as he went. When he was passing his uncle,\n",
      "the old man stirred in his sleep, and Tom stopped instantly--stopped,\n",
      "and softly drew the knife from its sheath, with his heart thumping, and\n",
      "his eyes fastened upon his benefactor's face. After a moment or two he\n",
      "ventured forward again--one step--reached for his prize and seized it,\n",
      "dropping the knife-sheath. Then he felt the old man's strong grip upon\n",
      "him, and a wild cry of \"Help! help!\" rang in his ear. Without hesitation\n",
      "he drove the knife home--and was free. Some of the notes escaped from\n",
      "his left hand and fell in the blood on the floor. He dropped the knife\n",
      "and snatched them up and started to fly; transferred them to his left\n",
      "hand, and seized the knife again, in his fright and confusion, but\n",
      "remembered himself and flung it from him, as being a dangerous witness\n",
      "to carry away with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "He jumped for the stair-foot, and closed the door behind him; and as he\n",
      "snatched his candle and fled upward, the stillness of the night was\n",
      "broken by the sound of urgent footsteps approaching the house. In\n",
      "another moment he was in his room and the twins were standing aghast\n",
      "over the body of the murdered man!\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom put on his coat, buttoned his hat under it, threw on his suit of\n",
      "girl's clothes, dropped the veil, blew out his light, locked the room\n",
      "door by which he had just entered, taking the key, passed through his\n",
      "other door into the back hall, locked that door and kept the key, then\n",
      "worked his way along in the dark and descended the back stairs. He was\n",
      "not expecting to meet anybody, for all interest was centered in the\n",
      "other part of the house, now; his calculation proved correct. By the\n",
      "time he was passing through the back-yard, Mrs. Pratt, her servants, and\n",
      "a dozen half-dressed neighbors had joined the twins and the dead, and\n",
      "accessions were still arriving at the front door.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Tom, quaking as with a palsy, passed out at the gate, three women\n",
      "came flying from the house on the opposite side of the lane. They rushed\n",
      "by him and in at the gate, asking him what the trouble was there, but\n",
      "not waiting for an answer. Tom said to himself, \"Those old maids waited\n",
      "to dress--they did the same thing the night Stevens's house burned down\n",
      "next door.\" In a few minutes he was in the haunted house. He lighted a\n",
      "candle and took off his girl-clothes. There was blood on him all down\n",
      "his left side, and his right hand was red with the stains of the\n",
      "blood-soaked notes which he had crushed in it; but otherwise he was free\n",
      "from this sort of evidence. He cleansed his hand on the straw, and\n",
      "cleaned most of the smut from his face. Then he burned his male and\n",
      "female attire to ashes, scattered the ashes, and put on a disguise\n",
      "proper for a tramp. He blew out his light, went below, and was soon\n",
      "loafing down the river road with the intent to borrow and use one of\n",
      "Roxy's devices. He found a canoe and paddled off down-stream, setting\n",
      "the canoe adrift as dawn approached, and making his way by land to the\n",
      "next village, where he kept out of sight till a transient steamer came\n",
      "along, and then took deck passage for St. Louis. He was ill at ease\n",
      "until Dawson's Landing was behind him; then he said to himself, \"All the\n",
      "detectives on earth couldn't trace me now; there's not a vestige of a\n",
      "clue left in the world; that homicide will take its place with the\n",

      "secret of it for fifty years.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "papers--dated at Dawson's Landing:\n",
      "\n",
      "Judge Driscoll, an old and respected citizen, was assassinated here\n",
      "about midnight by a profligate Italian nobleman or barber on account of\n",
      "a quarrel growing out of the recent election. The assassin will probably\n",
      "be lynched.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"One of the twins!\" soliloquized Tom; \"how lucky! It is the knife that\n",
      "has done him this grace. We never know when fortune is trying to favor\n",
      "us. I actually cursed Pudd'nhead Wilson in my heart for putting it out\n",
      "of my power to sell that knife. I take it back, now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom was now rich and independent. He arranged with the planter, and\n",
      "mailed to Wilson the new bill of sale which sold Roxana to herself; then\n",
      "he telegraphed his Aunt Pratt:\n",
      "\n",
      "Have seen the awful news in the papers and am almost prostrated with\n",
      "grief. Shall start by packet to-day. Try to bear up till I come.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Wilson reached the house of mourning and had gathered such details\n",
      "as Mrs. Pratt and the rest of the crowd could tell him, he took command\n",
      "as mayor, and gave orders that nothing should be touched, but everything\n",
      "left as it was until Justice Robinson should arrive and take the proper\n",
      "measures as coroner. He cleared everybody out of the room but the twins\n",
      "and himself. The sheriff soon arrived and took the twins away to jail.\n",
      "Wilson told them to keep heart, and promised to do his best in their\n",
      "defense when the case should come to trial. Justice Robinson came\n",
      "presently, and with him Constable Blake. They examined the room\n",
      "thoroughly. They found the knife and the sheath. Wilson noticed that\n",
      "there were finger-prints on the knife-handle. That pleased him, for the\n",
      "twins had required the earliest comers to make a scrutiny of their hands\n",
      "and clothes, and neither these people nor Wilson himself had found any\n",
      "blood-stains upon them. Could there be a possibility that the twins had\n",
      "spoken the truth when they said they found the man dead when they ran\n",
      "into the house in answer to the cry for help? He thought of that\n",
      "mysterious girl at once. But this was not the sort of work for a girl to\n",
      "be engaged in. No matter; Tom Driscoll's room must be examined.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the coroner's jury had viewed the body and its surroundings,\n",
      "Wilson suggested a search up-stairs, and he went along. The jury forced\n",
      "an entrance to Tom's room, but found nothing, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "The coroner's jury found that the homicide was committed by Luigi, and\n",
      "that Angelo was accessory to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The town was bitter against the unfortunates, and for the first few days\n",
      "after the murder they were in constant danger of being lynched. The\n",
      "grand jury presently indicted Luigi for murder in the first degree, and\n",
      "Angelo as accessory before the fact. The twins were transferred from the\n",
      "city jail to the county prison to await trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson examined the finger-marks on the knife-handle and said to\n",
      "himself, \"Neither of the twins made those marks.\" Then manifestly there\n",
      "was another person concerned, either in his own interest or as hired\n",
      "assassin.\n",
      "\n",
      "But who could it be? That, he must try to find out. The safe was not\n",
      "open, the cash-box was closed, and had three thousand dollars in it.\n",
      "Then robbery was not the motive, and revenge was. Where had the murdered\n",
      "man an enemy except Luigi? There was but that one person in the world\n",
      "with a deep grudge against him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mysterious girl! The girl was a great trial to Wilson. If the motive\n",
      "had been robbery, the girl might answer; but there wasn't any girl that\n",
      "would want to take this old man's life for revenge. He had no quarrels\n",
      "with girls; he was a gentleman.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson had perfect tracings of the finger-marks of the knife-handle; and\n",
      "among his glass-records he had a great array of finger-prints of women\n",
      "and girls, collected during the last fifteen or eighteen years, but he\n",
      "scanned them in vain, they successfully withstood every test; among them\n",
      "were no duplicates of the prints on the knife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The presence of the knife on the stage of the murder was a worrying\n",
      "circumstance for Wilson. A week previously he had as good as admitted to\n",
      "himself that he believed Luigi had possessed such a knife, and that he\n",
      "still possessed it notwithstanding his pretense that it had been stolen.\n",
      "And now here was the knife, and with it the twins. Half the town had\n",
      "said the twins were humbugging when they claimed that they had lost\n",
      "their knife, and now these people were joyful, and said, \"I told you\n",
      "so!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If their finger-prints had been on the handle--but it was useless to\n",
      "bother any further about that; the finger-prints on the handle were not\n",
      "theirs--that he knew perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson refused to suspect Tom; for first, Tom couldn't murder\n",
      "anybody--he hadn't character enough; secondly, if he could murder a\n",
      "person he wouldn't select his doting benefactor and nearest relative;\n",
      "thirdly, self-interest was in the way; for while the uncle lived, Tom\n",
      "was sure of a free support and a chance to get the destroyed will\n",
      "revived again, but with the uncle gone, that chance was gone, too. It\n",
      "was true the will had really been revived, as was now discovered, but\n",
      "Tom could not have been aware of it, or he would have spoken of it, in\n",
      "his native talky, unsecretive way. Finally, Tom was in St. Louis when\n",
      "the murder was done, and got the news out of the morning journals, as\n",
      "was shown by his telegram to his aunt. These speculations were\n",
      "unemphasized sensations rather than articulated thoughts, for Wilson\n",
      "would have laughed at the idea of seriously connecting Tom with the\n",
      "murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson regarded the case of the twins as desperate--in fact, about\n",
      "hopeless. For he argued that if a confederate was not found, an\n",
      "enlightened Missouri jury would hang them, sure; if a confederate was\n",
      "found, that would not improve the matter, but simply furnish one more\n",
      "person for the sheriff to hang. Nothing could save the twins but the\n",
      "discovery of a person who did the murder on his sole personal\n",
      "account--an undertaking which had all the aspect of the impossible.\n",
      "Still, the person who made the finger-prints must be sought. The twins\n",
      "might have no case with him, but they certainly would have none without\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Wilson mooned around, thinking, thinking, guessing, guessing, day and\n",
      "night, and arriving nowhere. Whenever he ran across a girl or a woman he\n",
      "was not acquainted with, he got her finger-prints, on one pretext or\n",
      "another; and they always cost him a sigh when he got home, for they\n",
      "never tallied with the finger-marks on the knife-handle.\n",
      "\n",
      "As to the mysterious girl, Tom swore he knew no such girl, and did not\n",
      "remember ever seeing a girl wearing a dress like the one described by\n",
      "Wilson. He admitted that he did not always lock his room, and that\n",
      "sometimes the servants forgot to lock the house doors; still, in his\n",
      "opinion the girl must have made but few visits or she would have been\n",
      "discovered. When Wilson tried to connect her with the stealing-raid, and\n",
      "thought she might have been the old woman's confederate, if not the very\n",
      "thief herself disguised as an old woman, Tom seemed stuck, and also much\n",
      "interested, and said he would keep a sharp eye out for this person or\n",
      "persons, although he was afraid that she or they would be too smart to\n",
      "venture again into a town where everybody would now be on the watch for\n",
      "a good while to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody was pitying Tom, he looked so quiet and sorrowful, and seemed\n",
      "to feel his great loss so deeply. He was playing a part, but it was not\n",
      "all a part. The picture of his alleged uncle, as he had last seen him,\n",
      "was before him in the dark pretty frequently, when he was awake, and\n",
      "called again in his dreams, when he was asleep. He wouldn't go into the\n",
      "room where the tragedy had happened. This charmed the doting Mrs. Pratt,\n",
      "who realized now, \"as she had never done before,\" she said, what a\n",
      "sensitive and delicate nature her darling had, and how he adored his\n",

      "he and she ought to be grateful to the twins for making them rich; but\n",
      "had roused such a temper in her by this speech that he did not repeat\n",

      "thousand times better than he deserved, and had never done her an\n",
      "unkindness in his life; so she hated these outlandish devils for killing\n",

      "left on the knife-handle, there being no need for that (for his trained\n",

      "time, \"Idiot that I was!--Nothing but a girl would do me--a man in\n",

      "unconsciously) made record.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now the series is complete,\" he said with satisfaction, and sat down to\n",
      "inspect these things and enjoy them.\n",
      "\n",
      "But his enjoyment was brief. He stared a considerable time at the three\n",

      "great and hopeful discovery which he had made. He made fine and accurate\n",
      "reproductions of a number of his \"records,\" and then enlarged them on a\n",
      "scale of ten to one with his pantograph. He did these pantograph\n",
      "enlargements on sheets of white cardboard, and made each individual line\n",

      "enlarged ten times they resembled the markings of a block of wood that\n",
      "has been sawed across the grain, and the dullest eye could detect at a\n",
      "glance, and at a distance of many feet, that no two of the patterns were\n",
      "alike. When Wilson had at last finished his tedious and difficult work,\n",
      "he arranged its results according to a plan in which a progressive order\n",

      "this--that the person whose hand left the blood-stained finger-prints\n",
      "upon the handle of the Indian knife is the person who committed the\n",
      "murder.\" Wilson paused, during several moments, to give impressiveness\n",
      "to what he was about to say, and then added tranquilly, \"We grant that\n",
      "claim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It was an electrical surprise. No one was prepared for such an\n",
      "admission. A buzz of astonishment rose on all sides, and people were\n",
      "heard to intimate that the overworked lawyer had lost his mind. Even the\n",
      "veteran judge, accustomed as he was to legal ambushes and masked\n",
      "batteries in criminal procedure, was not sure that his ears were not\n",
      "deceiving him, and asked counsel what it was he had said. Howard's\n",
      "impassive face betrayed no sign, but his attitude and bearing lost\n",
      "something of their careless confidence for a moment. Wilson resumed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We not only grant that claim, but we welcome it and strongly endorse\n",
      "it. Leaving that matter for the present, we will now proceed to consider\n",
      "other points in the case which we propose to establish by evidence, and\n",
      "shall include that one in the chain in its proper place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He had made up his mind to try a few hardy guesses, in mapping out his\n",
      "theory of the origin and motive of the murder--guesses designed to fill\n",
      "up gaps in it--guesses which could help if they hit, and would probably\n",
      "do no harm if they didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To my mind, certain circumstances of the case before the court seem to\n",
      "suggest a motive for the homicide quite different from the one insisted\n",
      "on by the State. It is my conviction that the motive was not revenge,\n",
      "but robbery. It has been urged that the presence of the accused brothers\n",
      "in that fatal room, just after notification that one of them must take\n",
      "the life of Judge Driscoll or lose his own the moment the parties should\n",
      "meet, clearly signifies that the natural instinct of self-preservation\n",
      "moved my clients to go there secretly and save Count Luigi by destroying\n",
      "his adversary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then why did they stay there, after the deed was done? Mrs. Pratt had\n",
      "time, although she did not hear the cry for help, but woke up some\n",
      "moments later, to run to that room--and there she found these men\n",
      "standing and making no effort to escape. If they were guilty, they ought\n",
      "to have been running out of the house at the same time that she was\n",
      "running to that room. If they had had such a strong instinct toward\n",
      "self-preservation as to move them to kill that unarmed man, what had\n",
      "become of it now, when it should have been more alert than ever? Would\n",
      "any of us have remained there? Let us not slander our intelligence to\n",
      "that degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Much stress has been laid upon the fact that the accused offered a very\n",
      "large reward for the knife with which this murder was done; that no\n",
      "thief came forward to claim that extraordinary reward; that the latter\n",
      "fact was good circumstantial evidence that the claim that the knife had\n",
      "been stolen was a vanity and a fraud; that these details taken in\n",
      "connection with the memorable and apparently prophetic speech of the\n",
      "deceased concerning that knife, and the final discovery of that very\n",
      "knife in the fatal room where no living person was found present with\n",
      "the slaughtered man but the owner of the knife and his brother, form an\n",
      "indestructible chain of evidence which fixes the crime upon those\n",
      "unfortunate strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I shall presently ask to be sworn, and shall testify that there was\n",
      "a large reward offered for the thief, also; and it was offered secretly\n",
      "and not advertised; that this fact was indiscreetly mentioned--or at\n",
      "least tacitly admitted--in what was supposed to be safe circumstances,\n",
      "but may not have been. The thief may have been present himself. [Tom\n",
      "Driscoll had been looking at the speaker, but dropped his eyes at this\n",
      "point.] In that case he would retain the knife in his possession, not\n",
      "daring to offer it for sale, or for pledge in a pawn-shop. [There was a\n",
      "nodding of heads among the audience by way of admission that this was\n",
      "not a bad stroke.] I shall prove to the satisfaction of the jury that\n",
      "there was a person in Judge Driscoll's room several minutes before the\n",
      "accused entered it. [This produced a strong sensation; the last\n",
      "drowsy-head in the court-room roused up, now, and made preparation to\n",
      "listen.] If it shall seem necessary, I will prove by the Misses Clarkson\n",
      "that they met a veiled person--ostensibly a woman--coming out of the\n",
      "back gate a few minutes after the cry for help was heard. This person\n",
      "was not a woman, but a man dressed in woman's clothes.\" Another\n",
      "sensation. Wilson had his eye on Tom when he hazarded this guess, to see\n",
      "what effect it would produce. He was satisfied with the result, and said\n",
      "to himself, \"It was a success--he's hit!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The object of that person in that house was robbery, not murder. It is\n",
      "true that the safe was not open, but there was an ordinary tin cash-box\n",
      "on the table, with three thousand dollars in it. It is easily supposable\n",
      "that the thief was concealed in the house; that he knew of this box, and\n",
      "of its owner's habit of counting its contents and arranging his accounts\n",
      "at night--if he had that habit, which I do not assert, of course;--that\n",
      "he tried to take the box while its owner slept, but made a noise and was\n",
      "seized, and had to use the knife to save himself from capture; and that\n",
      "he fled without his booty because he heard help coming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have now done with my theory, and will proceed to the evidences by\n",
      "which I propose to try to prove its soundness.\" Wilson took up several\n",
      "of his strips of glass. When the audience recognized these familiar\n",
      "mementoes of Pudd'nhead's old-time childish \"puttering\" and folly, the\n",
      "tense and funereal interest vanished out of their faces, and the house\n",
      "burst into volleys of relieving and refreshing laughter, and Tom chirked\n",
      "up and joined in the fun himself; but Wilson was apparently not\n",
      "disturbed. He arranged his records on the table before him, and said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I beg the indulgence of the court while I make a few remarks in\n",
      "explanation of some evidence which I am about to introduce, and which I\n",

      "stand. Every human being carries with him from his cradle to his grave\n",
      "certain physical marks which do not change their character, and by which\n",
      "he can always be identified--and that without shade of doubt or\n",
      "question. These marks are his signature, his physiological autograph, so\n",
      "to speak, and this autograph can not be counterfeited, nor can he\n",
      "disguise it or hide it away, nor can it become illegible by the wear and\n",
      "mutations of time. This signature is not his face--age can change that\n",
      "beyond recognition; it is not his hair, for that can fall out; it is not\n",
      "his height, for duplicates of that exist; it is not his form, for\n",
      "duplicates of that exist also, whereas this signature is each man's very\n",
      "own--there is no duplicate of it among the swarming populations of the\n",
      "globe! [The audience were interested once more.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This autograph consists of the delicate lines or corrugations with\n",
      "which Nature marks the insides of the hands and the soles of the feet.\n",
      "If you will look at the balls of your fingers,--you that have very sharp\n",
      "eyesight,--you will observe that these dainty curving lines lie close\n",
      "together, like those that indicate the borders of oceans in maps, and\n",
      "that they form various clearly defined patterns, such as arches,\n",
      "circles, long curves, whorls, etc., and that these patterns differ on\n",
      "the different fingers. [Every man in the room had his hand up to the\n",
      "light, now, and his head canted to one side, and was minutely\n",
      "scrutinizing the balls of his fingers; there were whispered ejaculations\n",
      "of 'Why, it's so--I never noticed that before!'] The patterns on the\n",
      "right hand are not the same as those on the left. [Ejaculations of 'Why,\n",
      "that's so, too!'] Taken finger for finger, your patterns differ from\n",
      "your neighbor's. [Comparisons were made all over the house--even the\n",
      "judge and jury were absorbed in this curious work.] The patterns of a\n",
      "twin's right hand are not the same as those on his left. One twin's\n",
      "patterns are never the same as his fellow-twin's patterns--the jury will\n",
      "find that the patterns upon the finger-balls of the accused follow this\n",
      "rule. [An examination of the twins' hands was begun at once.] You have\n",
      "often heard of twins who were so exactly alike that when dressed alike\n",
      "their own parents could not tell them apart. Yet there was never a twin\n",
      "born into this world that did not carry from birth to death a sure\n",
      "identifier in this mysterious and marvelous natal autograph. That once\n",
      "known to you, his fellow-twin could never personate him and deceive\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson stopped and stood silent. Inattention dies a quick and sure death\n",
      "when a speaker does that. The stillness gives warning that something is\n",
      "coming. All palms and finger-balls went down, now, all slouching forms\n",
      "straightened, all heads came up, all eyes were fastened upon Wilson's\n",
      "face. He waited yet one, two, three moments, to let his pause complete\n",
      "and perfect its spell upon the house; then, when through the profound\n",
      "hush he could hear the ticking of the clock on the wall, he put out his\n",
      "hand and took the Indian knife by the blade and held it aloft where all\n",
      "could see the sinister spots upon its ivory handle; then he said, in a\n",
      "level and passionless voice--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Upon this haft stands the assassin's natal autograph, written in the\n",
      "blood of that helpless and unoffending old man who loved you and whom\n",
      "you all loved. There is but one man in the whole earth whose hand can\n",
      "duplicate that crimson sign,\"--he paused and raised his eyes to the\n",

      "\n",
      "Stunned, distraught, unconscious of its own movement, the house half\n",
      "rose, as if expecting to see the murderer appear at the door, and a\n",
      "breeze of muttered ejaculations swept the place. \"Order in the\n",
      "court!--sit down!\" This from the sheriff. He was obeyed, and quiet\n",
      "reigned again. Wilson stole a glance at Tom, and said to himself, \"He is\n",
      "flying signals of distress, now; even people who despise him are pitying\n",
      "him; they think this is a hard ordeal for a young fellow who has lost\n",
      "his benefactor by so cruel a stroke--and they are right.\" He resumed his\n",
      "speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For more than twenty years I have amused my compulsory leisure with\n",
      "collecting these curious physical signatures in this town. At my house I\n",
      "have hundreds upon hundreds of them. Each and every one is labelled with\n",
      "name and date; not labelled the next day or even the next hour, but in\n",
      "the very minute that the impression was taken. When I go upon the\n",
      "witness stand I will repeat under oath the things which I am now saying.\n",
      "I have the finger-prints of the court, the sheriff, and every member of\n",
      "the jury. There is hardly a person in this room, white or black, whose\n",
      "natal signature I cannot produce, and not one of them can so disguise\n",
      "himself that I cannot pick him out from a multitude of his\n",
      "fellow-creatures and unerringly identify him by his hands. And if he and\n",
      "I should live to be a hundred I could still do it. [The interest of the\n",
      "audience was steadily deepening, now.]\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have studied some of these signatures so much that I know them as\n",
      "well as the bank cashier knows the autograph of his oldest customer.\n",
      "While I turn my back now, I beg that several persons will be so good as\n",
      "to pass their fingers through their hair, and then press them upon one\n",
      "of the panes of the window near the jury, and that among them the\n",
      "accused may set their finger-marks. Also, I beg that these\n",
      "experimenters, or others, will set their finger-marks upon another pane,\n",
      "and add again the marks of the accused, but not placing them in the same\n",
      "order or relation to the other signatures as before--for, by one chance\n",
      "in a million, a person might happen upon the right marks by pure\n",
      "guess-work once, therefore I wish to be tested twice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He turned his back, and the two panes were quickly covered with\n",
      "delicately-lined oval spots, but visible only to such persons as could\n",
      "get a dark background for them--the foliage of a tree, outside, for\n",
      "instance. Then, upon call, Wilson went to the window, made his\n",
      "examination, and said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is Count Luigi's right hand; this one, three signatures below, is\n",
      "his left. Here is Count Angelo's right; down here is his left. Now for\n",
      "the other pane: here and here are Count Luigi's, here and here are his\n",
      "brother's.\" He faced about. \"Am I right?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A deafening explosion of applause was the answer. The Bench said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This certainly approaches the miraculous!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson turned to the window again and remarked, pointing with his\n",
      "finger--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the signature of Mr. Justice Robinson. [Applause.] This, of\n",
      "Constable Blake. [Applause.] This, of John Mason, juryman. [Applause.]\n",
      "This, of the sheriff. [Applause.] I cannot name the others, but I have\n",
      "them all at home, named and dated, and could identify them all by my\n",
      "finger-print records.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved to his place through a storm of applause--which the sheriff\n",
      "stopped, and also made the people sit down, for they were all standing\n",
      "and struggling to see, of course. Court, jury, sheriff, and everybody\n",
      "had been too absorbed in observing Wilson's performance to attend to the\n",
      "audience earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, then,\" said Wilson, \"I have here the natal autographs of two\n",
      "children--thrown up to ten times the natural size by the pantograph, so\n",
      "that any one who can see at all can tell the markings apart at a glance.\n",
      "We will call the children A and B. Here are A's finger-marks, taken at\n",
      "the age of five months. Here they are again, taken at seven months. [Tom\n",
      "started.] They are alike, you see. Here are B's at five months, and also\n",
      "at seven months. They, too, exactly copy each other, but the patterns\n",
      "are quite different from A's, you observe. I shall refer to these again\n",
      "presently, but we will turn them face down, now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, thrown up ten sizes, are the natal autographs of the two persons\n",
      "who are here before you accused of murdering Judge Driscoll. I made\n",
      "these pantograph copies last night, and will so swear when I go upon the\n",
      "witness stand. I ask the jury to compare them with the finger-marks of\n",
      "the accused upon the window panes, and tell the court if they are the\n",
      "same.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He passed a powerful magnifying-glass to the foreman.\n",
      "\n",
      "One juryman after another took the cardboard and the glass and made the\n",
      "comparison. Then the foreman said to the judge--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your honor, we are all agreed that they are identical.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson said to the foreman--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Please turn that cardboard face down, and take this one, and compare it\n",
      "searchingly, by the magnifier, with the fatal signature upon the\n",
      "knife-handle, and report your finding to the court.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Again the jury made minute examinations, and again reported--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We find them to be exactly identical, your honor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wilson turned toward the counsel for the prosecution, and there was a\n",
      "clearly recognizable note of warning in his voice when he said--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"May it please the court, the State has claimed, strenuously and\n",
      "persistently, that the blood-stained finger-prints upon that\n",
      "knife-handle were left there by the assassin of Judge Driscoll. You have\n",
      "heard us grant that claim, and welcome it.\" He turned to the jury:\n",
      "\"Compare the finger-prints of the accused with the finger-prints left by\n",
      "the assassin--and report.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The comparison began. As it proceeded, all movement and all sound\n",
      "ceased, and the deep silence of an absorbed and waiting suspense settled\n",
      "upon the house; and when at last the words came--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They do not even resemble,\" a thunder-crash of applause followed and\n",
      "the house sprang to its feet, but was quickly repressed by official\n",
      "force and brought to order again. Tom was altering his position every\n",
      "few minutes, now, but none of his changes brought repose nor any small\n",
      "trifle of comfort. When the house's attention was become fixed once\n",
      "more, Wilson said gravely, indicating the twins with a gesture--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"These men are innocent--I have no further concern with them. [Another\n",
      "outbreak of applause began, but was promptly checked.] We will now\n",
      "proceed to find the guilty. [Tom's eyes were starting from their\n",
      "sockets--yes, it was a cruel day for the bereaved youth, everybody\n",
      "thought.] We will return to the infant autographs of A and B. I will ask\n",
      "the jury to take these large pantograph facsimilies of A's marked five\n",
      "months and seven months. Do they tally?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The foreman responded--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perfectly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now examine this pantograph, taken at eight months, and also marked A.\n",
      "Does it tally with the other two?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The surprised response was--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No--they differ widely!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are quite right. Now take these two pantographs of B's autograph,\n",
      "marked five months and seven months. Do they tally with each other?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes--perfectly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Take this third pantograph marked B, eight months. Does it tally with\n",
      "B's other two?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"By no means!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you know how to account for those strange discrepancies? I will tell\n",
      "you. For a purpose unknown to us, but probably a selfish one, somebody\n",
      "changed those children in the cradle.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This produced a vast sensation, naturally; Roxana was astonished at this\n",
      "admirable guess, but not disturbed by it. To guess the exchange was one\n",
      "thing, to guess who did it quite another. Pudd'nhead Wilson could do\n",
      "wonderful things, no doubt, but he couldn't do impossible ones. Safe?\n",
      "She was perfectly safe. She smiled privately.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Between the ages of seven months and eight months those children were\n",
      "changed in the cradle\"--he made one of his effect-collecting pauses, and\n",
      "added--\"and the person who did it is in this house!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Roxy's pulses stood still! The house was thrilled as with an electric\n",
      "shock, and the people half rose as if to seek a glimpse of the person\n",
      "who had made that exchange. Tom was growing limp; the life seemed oozing\n",
      "out of him. Wilson resumed:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A was put into B's cradle in the nursery; B was transferred to the\n",
      "kitchen and became a negro and a slave, [Sensation--confusion of angry\n",
      "ejaculations]--but within a quarter of an hour he will stand before you\n",
      "white and free! [Burst of applause, checked by the officers.] From seven\n",
      "months onward until now, A has still been a usurper, and in my\n",
      "finger-record he bears B's name. Here is his pantograph at the age of\n",
      "twelve. Compare it with the assassin's signature upon the knife-handle.\n",

      "The foreman answered--\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the minutest detail!\"\n",

      "manners were the manners of a slave. Money and fine clothes could not\n",
      "mend these defects or cover them up; they only made them the more\n",

      "years; that they had already lost sufficiently in being deprived of his\n",
      "services during that long period, and ought not to be required to add\n",
      "anything to that loss; that if he had been delivered up to them in the\n",
      "first place, they would have sold him and he could not have murdered\n",
      "Judge Driscoll; therefore it was not he that had really committed the\n",
